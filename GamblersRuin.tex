Gamblers Ruin Problem

Really we should be using a while loop for this problem. But for now let us just assume that it is almost impossible
for the gambler to last more than 5000 rounds, if his initial wealth is less than 50 and the probability of success is less than 50%

p = 0.47

Rounds = np.sign(p-np.random.random(5000) ) 


This will generate a sequences of -1s or 1s (with 53% and 47% probability respectively)
An outcome of -1 means the gambler has lost a round ( and looses 1 euro). Conversely an outcome of 1 means the gambler has 1 euro.

To get an idea of the Gambler's Progress, we can use the `cumsum` function.

np.cumsum(Rounds)

This assumes an initial starting wealth of 0. If our gambler starts with 50 euro, for example. We could determine his ongoing bank balance as follows

A = 50.

GamblersWealth = np.cumsum(np.array(A, Rounds) )

GamblersWealth[0]  #  Gamblers initial Wealth
GamblersWealth[10] #  Gamblers Wealth after round 10.

Necessarily the gambling ends when the Gambler runs out of money. 
(For the time being, We will assume  that the Banker is infinitely rich, and can never go broke. Later on we will change that assumption, allowing for a scenario 
where the gambler can potentially bankrupt the banker)
