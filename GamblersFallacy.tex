Gambler's Fallacy

Chains

 - First off lets present Red with 0s and Blacks with 1s
 - We can use the Randint function to generate a sequence of roulette spins (rather simplified)
 - We will also set up an array called RowSeq to record how many times in a row red or black came up

 For example, if we have a Spins sequence like this 
  
 0,0,0,1,1,0,0,1,...

 The corresponding RowSeq sequence

 1,2,3,1,2,1,2,1,....

Is the RowSeq a Poisson Random Variables?

mean and variance are roughly equal to each other
